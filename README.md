# 4x Super-resolution by CNN
Investigation in 4x Super-resolution by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The network designs are my own and they work in the RGB color space.

Investigations regarding 3 major factors are carried out.
* Incremental upsampling
* Perceptual Loss
* Sup-pixel convolution

For results and more info see the Powerpoint Presentation.
